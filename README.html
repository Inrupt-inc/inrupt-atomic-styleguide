<h1 id="inruptatomicdesignsystem">inrupt Atomic Design System</h1>

<p>A Live respository of UI styles and UX patterns utilized by the inrupt generator for Solid React applications (<a href="https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/generator-solid-react" target="_blank">https://github.com/Inrupt-inc/generator-solid-react</a>). By leveraging Nick Berens&#8217; Atomic Docs framework (inspired by Brad Frost&#8217;s Atomic design principles) as a base style guide/design system generation tool, the inrupt creative and front-end development team define UI/UX decisions and styled components are documented here to be used across inrupt applications. </p>

<p>This design system can be downloaded and customized for unique theming in your solid react projects. </p>

<p>Note: As this is a living design system, new compenents are continually added and refactored as the design system evolves. </p>

<h2 id="setup:">Set up:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Download Atomic Docs and add to your local PHP environment.</li>
<li>Configure your preprocessor to output <code>scss/main.scss</code> to <code>css/main.css</code>.</li>
<li>Go to <code>http://localhost/atomic-docs/atomic-core/index.php</code> and get started.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="builtwith:">Built With:</h2>

<p>Built using Nick Berens&#8217; Atomic Docs Framework based in PHP and SASS/SCSS. </p>

<p>Additional documentation regarding the Atomic Docs framework and installation can be found at <a href="http://atomicdocs.io/">AtomicDocs.io</a>.</p>

<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

<p>We started this project wanting to create a home where creatives and developers could document UI/UX patterns &amp; design decisions, and UI styles and FE guidelines. This framework allows us to reduce siloed knowledge, crafting a source of truth for inrupt application interfaces. This documentation and examples can then be utilized to accellerate additional application projects. </p>

<p>As we continue working on new applications and features, the inrupt Atomic Design System will evolve as we commit and release new patterns and features. </p>
